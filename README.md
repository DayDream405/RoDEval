## RoDEval: A Robust Word Sense Disambiguation Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models (EMNLP2025 main)

Run:

```python
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

to install the required Python packages for running the framework. **Note:** You will also need to configure the runtime environment for the large language models to be tested.



This framework includes pre-built modules for processing five public English word sense disambiguation (WSD) test datasets, three types of WSD tasks, and one data leakage detection task.
